## üìÇ Dataset Overview

This project uses the [Beverage Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sebastianwillmann/beverage-sales/data), available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LCroYoIqObck-SCWcstuhEz358tU2qQy/view?usp=sharing). It highlights key factors in the beverage industry, including customer, product categories, and order details. However for this project we used local path you can replace it with your link to the data if fetching from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LCroYoIqObck-SCWcstuhEz358tU2qQy/view?usp=sharing)

### Dataset Columns  
| Column          | Description                                                                 |  
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Order_ID**     | Unique identifier for each order. Groups multiple products within the same order. |  
| **Customer_ID**  | Unique identifier for each customer, distinguishing individual buyers.      |  
| **Customer_Type**| Indicates whether the customer is B2B or B2C.                              |  
| **Product**      | Name of the purchased product (e.g., "Coca-Cola", "Erdinger Wei√übier").     |

## üéØ Goals  

1. **Customer Type Prediction**  
   Build models to predict whether a customer is B2B or B2C based on their purchase behavior.  

2. **Price Prediction**  
   Use data features like product, quantity, and region to forecast the pricing of beverages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation  

We explored various machine learning models to achieve the goals and selected the best-performing models for each task. However, there is still room for improvement in model performance through advanced techniques or additional data preprocessing.  

### Models Used  

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forests  
- Gradient Boosting Machines  
- Neural Networks (for advanced tasks)
